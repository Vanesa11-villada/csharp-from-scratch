# Basic Concepts and Programming Task

This repository contains the full process for the "Basic Concepts and Programming" task. It includes the development of C# programming skills by focusing on core topics such as conditionals, loops, inheritance, polymorphism, exceptions, and more. The task is divided into multiple branches, each addressing different fundamental concepts in programming.

## Branches Overview

1. **`csharp-01`** - Initial setup and "Hello World" program.
2. **`csharp-02`** - Updates to the `Program.cs` with basic example.
3. **`csharp-03`** - Updates to the `Program.cs` with others basic examples.
4. **`csharp-04`** - Conditional Statements and their usage in the program (e.g., `if`, `else`, `else if`).
5. **`csharp-05`** - Classes and Inheritance, including abstract classes and methods.
6. **`csharp-06`** - Loops, polymorphism, and exception handling (e.g., `for` loop, `try-catch` block).
7. **`final`** - Final version with a controller to select challenges, including the `challenges` folder with exercises like Challenge1, Challenge2, and more. This is the final task that consolidates all learned concepts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into different folders and files to structure the tasks and challenges:

- **Challenges Folder**: Contains various challenges like `Challenge1.cs`.
- **Program.cs**: Main entry point of the application where different tasks are demonstrated.
- **`final` Folder**: Includes a controller that allows the user to select and run different challenges interactively.
